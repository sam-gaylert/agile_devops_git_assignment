## [Clean Architecture](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-quick-introduction-to-clean-architecture-990c014448d2)

I find this article interesting because it succinctly explains how to make more robust an scalable large scale applications. A common problem I used to run into before learning about advanced project structure was that projects quickly became so interconnected and complex that it was almost impossible to easily add any changes or improvements. The clean architecture explained in this article is one of many ways that software engineers can structure their large scale projects in order to facilitate change and expansion. The writer of this post is aware of the challenging concepts behind clean architecture, and takes care to explain them well and provide code examples so that readers can have a firm understanding of the process when finished with the article.

Cool article. I really like how he showed the file structure of a project using his "clean architecture" method. It could be very useful for keeping a large project organized as it scales.
